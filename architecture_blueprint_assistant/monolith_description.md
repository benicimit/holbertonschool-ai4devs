# Monolithic Architecture Description

This monolithic architecture for the AI Learning Assistant integrates all components into a single, unified application. Below is a short explanation of the key components:

1. **User Interface**: Handles web and mobile interactions, providing access to learning content, dashboards, and user controls.
2. **Authentication Module**: Manages user login, registration, and session security using corporate SSO.
3. **Learning Management Module**: Oversees course creation, enrollment, progress tracking, and adaptive learning paths.
4. **AI Engine**: Processes user data to generate personalized recommendations, adaptive quizzes, and performance insights.
5. **Content Management Module**: Stores and manages educational content, including videos, quizzes, and documents.
6. **Analytics Module**: Collects and analyzes user data for progress reports, environmental impact (if applicable), and performance metrics.
7. **Notification Module**: Sends alerts, reminders, and updates to users via email or in-app notifications.
8. **Database**: A centralized data store for user profiles, content, analytics, and session data.

All components share the same codebase and runtime environment, communicating directly without network calls. External APIs (e.g., for third-party content) are integrated as needed.
